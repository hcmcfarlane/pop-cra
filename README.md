# Portfolio website: under construction

After designing (and nearly finishing) my portfolio website using plain HTML and JS, I decided that restarting the project as a single-page React app would offer more functionality and give me an opportunity to continue practicing my React development skills. Page still very much under construction!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
